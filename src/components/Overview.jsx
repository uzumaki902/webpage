        About the Workshop
      </h2>

      <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
        The four-day symposium, “Next-Generation Wastewater Treatment Modelling
        and Control,” will be held from March 24–27, 2026 at Vellore Institute
        of Technology (VIT), Chennai. The program focuses on dynamic process
        modelling, advanced control strategies (including MPC and AI-based
        control), real-time monitoring, and data-driven optimization to enhance
        the efficiency and sustainability of wastewater treatment systems.
        Participants will gain practical insights into developing smart,
        automated, and energy-efficient treatment facilities aligned with modern
        environmental standards.
